  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>VidyaGyan is a radical social initiative of the Shiv Nadar Foundation (SNF).</p>
  <p>Established in 1994, Shiv Nadar Foundation is one of the largest philanthropic institutions in India today. SNF believes that transformational education is the most powerful tool for socio- economic transformation and for creating leaders of global stature. In its quest to make India a talent pool of global leaders, the Foundation is investing generously in creating leadership institutions par excellence across the spectrum of education, both in urban and rural India.</p>
  <p>SNF launched VidyaGyan to bridge the urban-rural divide by developing leaders from the economically underprivileged communities of rural India, using 21st century learning and development techniques. The inspiration stems from the belief that high-quality education will have a positive impact on the academic and socio-economic structure of the society to a point where it can truly uplift and transform lives. VidyaGyan aims to provide the opportunities of a world-class leadership academy to the economically backward students of rural India and transform their lives using high quality school education. VidyaGyan brings students from rural India, who are potential high achievers, particularly ones who lack the advantage of exposure to a competitive environment, at par with their urban counterparts.</p>
